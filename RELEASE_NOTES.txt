=== 1.2.0 ===
Sep 9, 2008 (revision 519)

- Refactored HTTP request mechanisms and the way that Authorization headers
    are created and applied to requests. These changes make it easier to 
    swap out the HTTP layer to allow the library to be used in different
    environments (like Google App Engine). The changes in Auth token logic
    should make it much easier to add support for secure AuthSub and OAuth.
    For more details on this change, see the following wiki page:
    http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/wiki/HTTPRequestRefactoring
- Fixed issues with token string modification which caused certain AuthSub 
    token values to become invalid.
- Created a new module for parsing and constructing URLs (atom.url).
- Created a module for token storage which will lookup the correct auth token
    to be used for a particular URL.
- Auth tokens are now represented as objects and contain information about the
    scopes (URLs) for which they can be used. The token object is responsible
    for adding the Authorization header to the request.
- Added new functions to gdata.auth for extracting the raw token string from
    a response to an AuthSub token upgrade request.
- Added support for the location query parameter in YouTube queries.
- Added groups functionality to the Contacts API library.
- Batch request support added for Contacts API operations.
- Added default behavior to text_db GetTables: when no worksheet name or ID
    is specified, all tables are retrieved.
- Fixed client login for YouTube.
- Fixed issue in YouTube service when setting the developer key.
- Fixed bug in YouTube service which raised an exception when inserting a
    video using a file-like object.
- Added a method to Feed and Entry classes to find the "previous" link.
- A failure when attempting to upgrade a single use AuthSub token to a session
    token will now raise an exception.
- AppsForYourDomainException now uses Python2.5 style exception construction.
- Moved the logic for using this library on Google App Engine into a new 
    module: gdata.alt.appengine.

=== 1.1.1 ===
June 13, 2008 (revision 421)

- Added support for new feeds available in the Google Contacts API. Adding
    contact groups, querying for contacts in a group, specifying extended
    properties, and setting the contact's photo are now supported.
- The ExtendedProperty class can now contain a blob of XML instead of just
    an attribute value. This is used in the Google Contacts Data API. 
- The YouTube service now has methods for updating playlists and removing a
    video from a playlist.
- Added geo-location to the YouTube service class.
- When using ClientLogin with Blogger, the default account type is now set
    to 'GOOGLE'. This prevents the rare problem of a user having a Google
    Apps account which conflicts with his or her Google Account used for
    Blogger.
- Added support for the in-reply-to element which appears in Blogger 
    comments.

    at the start of the token to be removed incorrectly.
- Fixed a bug in the gdata.apps.service module which caused an import to 
    fail when loading ElementTree in some cases.

    API feel more like using a simple database. This module streamlines use
    of the list feed.
- Compatibility fixes for geo and photos modules to run on Python 2.2 and 2.3.
- Added the orderby parameter to gdata.service's Query class.
- Changed the blogger sample to use orderby=updated so that queries on 
    updated min or max will work.

=== 1.0.11 ===
February 11, 2008 (revision 290)

- Modified the gdata.service.GDataService to include a handler member to 
    which all HTTP requests are delegated. This will allow the underlying
    HTTP client to be swapped out and pave the way for use of a mock server
    in unit tests.
- Fixed character encoding problems when parsing non ASCII XML.
- Added pydocs for gdata's geo, exif, and media packages.
